# [Project 1 - Guided Project: Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/rashad-malik/project_dq_jeopardy/blob/main/project_dq_jeopardy.ipynb)
In this project, I worked with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help me win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).
