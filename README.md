## Dataquest guided projects
Dataquest's guided projects are an interactive component of their online learning platform. These projects offer a hands-on, real-world experience that complements the theoretical knowledge gained on the course. This involves work with real datasets, writing code, and solving data-related problems.

### [Project 13 - Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/rashad-malik/Dataquest-Projects/blob/main/Project%2013%3A%20Winning%20Jeopardy/Project_13.ipynb)
In this project, I worked with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help me win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).
