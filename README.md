## Dataquest guided projects
Dataquest's guided projects are an interactive component of their online learning platform. These projects offer a hands-on, real-world experience that complements the theoretical knowledge gained on the course. This involves work with real datasets, writing code, and solving data-related problems.

### [Project 3 - Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/rashad-malik/Dataquest-Projects/blob/main/Project%203%3A%20Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts/Project_3.ipynb)
This guided project brought the following skills together for some real-world practice:
- How to work with strings
- Object-oriented programming
- Dates and times
In this project, I worked with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

### [Project 6 - Storytelling Data Visualisation on Exchange Rates](https://github.com/rashad-malik/Dataquest-Projects/blob/main/Project%206%3A%20Storytelling%20Data%20Visualisation%20on%20Exchange%20Rates/Project_6.ipynb)
This following project focused on explanatory data visualisation, and demonstrates the following:
- Using information design principles (familiarity and maximising the data-ink ratio) to create better graphs for an audience.
- How to create storytelling data visualisations using Matplotlib.
- How to create visual patterns using Gestalt principles.
- How to guide the audience's attention with pre-attentive attributes.
- How to use Matplotlib built-in styles — with a case study on the FiveThirtyEight style.
The dataset used describes the Euro (€) daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021, hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) by [Daria Chemkaeva](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18).

### [Project 13 - Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/rashad-malik/Dataquest-Projects/blob/main/Project%2013%3A%20Winning%20Jeopardy/Project_13.ipynb)
In this project, I worked with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help me win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).
